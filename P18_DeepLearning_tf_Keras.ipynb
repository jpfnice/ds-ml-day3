    "# Deep Learning using tf.keras\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help to optimize and refine for accuracy.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning drives many artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention (digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes, credit card fraud detection, ...) as well as emerging technologies (such as self-driving cars).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep neural networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, each building upon the previous layer to refine and optimize the prediction or categorization. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This progression of computations through the network is called **forward propagation**. <br>\n",
    "The input and output layers of a deep neural network are called visible layers. The **input layer** is where the deep learning model ingests the data for processing, and the **output layer** is where the final prediction or classification is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another process called **backpropagation** uses algorithms, like gradient descent, to calculate errors in predictions and then adjusts the weights and biases of the function by moving backwards through the layers in an effort to train the model. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, forward propagation and backpropagation allow a neural network to make predictions and correct for any errors accordingly. Over time, the algorithm becomes gradually more accurate.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above describes the simplest type of deep neural network in the simplest terms. However, deep learning algorithms can be very complex, and there are different types of neural networks to address specific problems or datasets. <br>\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convolutional neural networks** (CNNs), used primarily in computer vision and image classification applications, can detect features and patterns within an image, enabling tasks, like object detection or recognition. In 2015, a CNN bested a human in an object recognition challenge for the first time.<br>\n",
    "- **Recurrent neural network** (RNNs) typically used in natural language and speech recognition applications as it leverages sequential or times series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keras and TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keras** is an open-source deep learning library (project started in 2015) written in Python.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Created by the Google Brain team, **TensorFlow** is an open source library (project also started in 2015) for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. <br>\n",
    "TensorFlow bundles together a slew of machine learning and deep learning models and algorithms and makes them useful by way of a common metaphor. <br>\n",
    "It uses Python to provide a convenient front-end API for building applications with the framework, while executing those applications in high-performance C++.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "During the period of 2015-2019, developing deep learning models using `TensorFlow` (but also `Theano`, or `PyTorch`) was cumbersome, requiring tens or even hundreds of lines of code to achieve the simplest tasks. <br>\n",
    "The focus of these libraries was on flexibility, and speed, not ease of use.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`Keras` is popular because the API is clean and simple, allowing standard deep learning models to be defined, fit, and evaluated in just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Keras` gives the possibility to use several popular deep learning mathematical libraries as the backend (to perform the computation), such as TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. This allowed the power of these libraries to be harnessed (e.g. GPUs) with a very clean and simple interface.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, Google released a new version of their TensorFlow deep learning library (**TensorFlow 2**) that integrated the Keras API directly and promoted this interface as the default or standard interface for deep learning development on the platform.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration is commonly referred to as the **tf.keras** interface or API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that TensorFlow is now the de facto standard backend for the Keras open source project, the integration means that a single library can now be used instead of two separate ones. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: you can install tensorflow using the traditionnal commands (`pip install tensorflow` or `conda install tensorflow`) and check it's version via: `tensorflow.__version__`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will give you an overview of how to define a deep learning model using the **tf.keras** API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Keras Model Life-Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Keras** model has a life-cycle, similar to other models, composed of 5 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the model**: defining the model requires that you first select the type of model that you need and then choose the architecture or network topology.<br> From an API perspective, this involves defining the **layers** of the model, configuring each layer with a **number of nodes** and **activation function**, and connecting the layers together into a cohesive model.<br> Models can be defined either with the **Sequential API** or the **Functional API**.<br>\n",
    "2. **Compile the model**: compiling the model requires that you first select a **loss** function that you want to optimize, such as `mean squared error` or `cross-entropy`.<br>It also requires that you select an algorithm to perform the **optimization procedure**, typically `stochastic gradient descent`, or a modern variation, such as `Adam`. <br>It may also require that you select any **performance metrics** to keep track of during the model training process.\n",
    "3. **Fit the model**: fitting the model requires that you first select the training configuration, such as the number of **epochs** (loops through the training dataset) and the **batch size** (number of samples in an epoch used to estimate model error).<br> Training applies the chosen optimization algorithm to minimize the chosen **loss** function and updates the model using the backpropagation of error algorithm.<br> Fitting the model is the slow part of the whole process and can take seconds to hours to days, depending on the complexity of the model, the hardware you’re using, and the size of the training dataset.\n",
    "4. **Evaluate the model**: evaluating the model requires that you first choose a holdout dataset used to evaluate the model. <br>This should be data not used in the training process so that we can get an unbiased estimate of the performance of the model when making predictions on new data.<br>\n",
    "5. **Make predictions**: making a prediction is the final step (and goal) in the life-cycle. <br>It requires you have new data for which a prediction (a class label probability, a numerical value, ...) is required.<br>You may want to save the model and later load it to make predictions. <br>\n",

    "### The Sequential Model API \n",
    "\n",
    "The **sequential model API** is the simplest API.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is referred to as \"sequential\" because it involves defining a **Sequential** class and adding layers to the model one by one in a linear manner, from input to output.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below defines a Sequential MLP model used for a classification problem. It accepts 4 inputs, has 2 hidden layers with 10 nodes and 8 nodes and then an output layer with 3 nodes (1 per class).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The input layer is created implicitly: it's size is defined by the **input_shape** argument on the first hidden layer. <br>\n",
    "That means in the following example, the model expects the input for one sample to be a vector of 4 numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequential API is easy to use: you keep calling **model.add()** until you have added all of your layers."

    "### How many layers, how many nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Every neural network is composed (at the maximum) of three types of layers: **input**, **hidden**, and **output**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the NN architecture therefore means coming up with values for the number of layers of each type and the number of nodes in each of these layers.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Input Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Every NN has exactly one **input layer**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the number of neurons comprising this layer, this parameter is completely and uniquely determined once you know the shape of your training data: the number of neurons comprising that layer is equal to the number of features in your data. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some NN configurations add one additional node for a **bias** term.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Output Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the Input layer, every NN has exactly one **output layer**. <br> \n",

    "The size of the output layer is completely determined by the chosen model configuration.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the NN used for classification or regression ? <br>\n",

    "If the NN is a regressor, then the output layer has a single node.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the NN is a classifier, then it also has a single node unless the activation `softmax` function is used in which case the output layer has one node per class label in your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Hidden Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How many hidden layers? <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Well if your data is linearly separable then you don't need any hidden layers at all (you don't even need an NN to resolve your data either, but it will still do the job).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond that, it is difficult to determine, in advance, how many hidden layers are needed.<br>\n",
    "Nevertheless there is a consensus: adding additional hidden layers decrease the performance of the model. <br>\n",

    "One hidden layer is sufficient for the large majority of problems.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the size of the hidden layer(s)?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some empirically-derived rules-of-thumb, of these, the most commonly relied on is 'the optimal size of the hidden layer is usually between the size of the input and size of the output layers'. <br>\n",

    "If we except this last kind of NN, the best strategy to find the proper number of hidden layers is an empirical one: split your data into training, cross validation, and test sets, and train neural networks with 1, 2, and 3 hidden layers, then see which one has the lowest cross validation error to choose an architecture."

    "### Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "An **activation function** in a neural network defines how the weighted sum of the input is transformed into an output from a node or nodes in a layer of the network.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of activation function has a large impact on the capability and performance of the neural network, and <u>different activation functions may be used in different parts of the model</u>.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, the activation function is used within or after the internal processing of each node in the network, although networks are designed to use the <u>same activation function for all nodes in a layer</u>.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>All hidden layers typically use the same activation function</u>. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The output layer will typically use a different activation function from the hidden layers and is dependent upon the type of prediction required by the model.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions are also typically differentiable, meaning the first-order derivative can be calculated for a given input value. This is required given that neural networks are typically trained using the backpropagation of error algorithm that requires the derivative of prediction error in order to update the weights of the model.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of activation functions used in neural networks, although perhaps only a small number of functions used in practice for hidden and output layers.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, <u>a differentiable nonlinear activation function is used in the hidden layers</u> of a neural network. This allows the model to learn more complex functions than a network trained using a linear activation function.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activation function for hidden layers\n",
    "\n",
    "There are perhaps three activation functions you may want to consider for use in hidden layers; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rectified Linear Activation (ReLU)\n",
    "2. Logistic (Sigmoid)\n",
    "3. Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ReLU \n",
    "\n",
    "**ReLU** activation function, is perhaps the most common function used for hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common because it is both simple to implement and effective at overcoming the limitations of other previously popular activation functions, such as `Sigmoid` and `Tanh`. Specifically, it is less susceptible to vanishing gradients that prevent deep models from being trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReLU function is calculated as follows: if the input value is negative, then a value 0.0 is returned, otherwise, the value is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the ReLU function for hidden layers, it is a good practice to use a **He Normal** or **He Uniform** weight initialization and <u>scale input data to the range 0-1</u> (normalize) prior to training.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sigmoid\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sigmoid** activation function is also called the logistic function. It is the same function used in the logistic regression classification algorithm.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes any real value as input and outputs values in the range 0 to 1. The larger the input (more positive), the closer the output value will be to 1.0, whereas the smaller the input (more negative), the closer the output will be to 0.0.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid activation function is calculated as follows: 1.0 / (1.0 + e^-x)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the Sigmoid function for hidden layers, it is a good practice to use a **Xavier Normal** or **Xavier Uniform** weight initialization (also referred to Glorot initialization) and <u>scale input data to the range 0-1</u> prior to training.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tanh \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tanh** (hyperbolic tangent) activation function is very similar to the sigmoid activation function.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes any real value as input and outputs values in the range -1 to 1. The larger the input (more positive), the closer the output value will be to 1.0, whereas the smaller the input (more negative), the closer the output will be to -1.0.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tanh activation function is calculated as follows: (e^x – e^-x) / (e^x + e^-x)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the Tanh function for hidden layers, it is a good practice to use a **Xavier Normal** or **Xavier Uniform** weight initialization and <u>scale input data to the range -1 - +1</u> prior to training.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the `sigmoid` and `Tanh` functions can make the model more susceptible to problems during training, via the so-called vanishing gradients problem.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern neural network models with common architectures, such as MLP and CNN, will make use of the ReLU activation function, or extensions.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent networks still commonly use Tanh or sigmoid activation functions, or even both.<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activation for Output Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used activation functions for use in the output layer are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear\n",
    "2. Logistic (Sigmoid)\n",
    "3. Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Linear Output Activation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **linear activation** function (also called **identity**) does not change the weighted sum of the input in any way and instead returns the value directly.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Target values used to train a model with a linear activation function in the output layer are typically scaled prior to modeling using normalization or standardization transforms.<br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sigmoid Output Activation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Target labels used to train a model with a **sigmoid** activation function in the output layer will have the values 0 or 1.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If your problem is a classification problem with two mutually exclusive classes (binary classification), then your output layer will have one node and a `sigmoid` activation function should be used.<br>\n",

    "## Convolutional Neural Network Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolutional Neural Networks**, or **CNN**s for short, are a type of network designed for <u>image input</u>.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "They are comprised of models with `convolutional layers` that extract features (called feature maps) and `pooling layers` that distill features down to the next layer.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolution Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "CNN are composed of **Convolutional layers**. A Convolutional layer is the layers that focus on neighbouring/local properties of an image rather than the complete input image.\n",
    "A n\\*n 2D matrix with some predefined values is called a kernel. The kernel moves step by step on the entire image. Each value is multiplied with the corresponding inplace value on image and summed to get the output value:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nbimages/convolution.jpeg\" alt=\"Convolution Layer\" title=\"Convolution Layer\" width=400 height=300 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the size of the input reduces after convolution layer because it can't process values at the edges. For a 3x3 kernel size convolution, a NxN image converts to N-1xN-1 size.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **tf.keras.layers.Conv2D()** convolution layer takes the following argument:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **filter**: number of different types of convolutions used ,(initially they are set to some predefined convolution and slowly trained to find better features in the image).\n",
    "- **kernel_size**: 2 integers, specifying the height and width of the 2D convolution window. Can be a single integer to specify the same value for all spatial dimensions.\n",
    "- **activation**: activation function\n",
    "- **input_shape** Size of each input to the convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1))`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pooling Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pooling layers** are used to reduce the dimension of the image. There are many types of pooling layers in CNN like **Max Pooling**, **Average Pooling**, **Global Pooling** etc. The most common is **Max Pooling**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In max pooling the pixel with maximum value is the output on a pool size of n\\*n:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nbimages/filter.png\" alt=\"Pooling Layer\" title=\"Pooling Layer\" width=400 height=300 />\n",
    "\n",
    "The **tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D()** convolution layer takes the following argument:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pool_size**: Dimension of pooling kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: `tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are most well-suited to image classification tasks, although they can be used on a wide array of tasks that take images as input.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular image classification task is the `MNIST handwritten digit classification`. It involves tens of thousands of handwritten digits that must be classified as a number between 0 and 9.<br>\n",
